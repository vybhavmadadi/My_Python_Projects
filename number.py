# Arithmetic Operators:
# Addition: 3 + 2
# Subtraction: 3 - 2
# Multiplication: 3 * 2
# Division: 3 / 2
# Floor Division: 3 // 2
# Exponent: 3 ** 2
# Modulus: 3 % 2

# Increment syntax +=, *=

# Comparison Operators:
# Equal: 3 == 2
# Not Equal: 3 != 2
# Greater Than: 3 > 2
# Less Than: 3 < 2
# Greater or Equal: 3 >= 2
# Less or Equal: 3 <= 2

# Looks like number but is string, you need to do casting like this,
